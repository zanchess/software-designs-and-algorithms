# Necessary knowledge

Basic programming knowledge and understanding main principles and concepts of Front-End development. Participants must have basic knowledge in:

- JS Core
- TypeScript (see more details about TS bellow)
- Tools (Infrastructure)

ENGX Bootcamp course completion is needed to register for the program

English: B1+

Course Goal
After the program attendees will be able to:

Apply OOP skills in practice;
Identify design patterns in codebase, write code using design patterns;
Apply knowledge of SOLID design principles;
Write cleaner code;
Design code with effective structures and algorithms. Know their benefits and disadvantages.
Rules of Conduct
Each mentor has a group of mentees that do not change through the program. However, there can be some exceptional cases.

## ðŸ›  Importance of TypeScript knowledge for the course

There is an expectation that participants of the course know [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) on the basic level. Almost all code snippets presented in the course are written in TypeScript. So, why is TypeScript important for the course?

Exploring OOP and design patterns the following keywords are usually mentioned: [abstraction](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2019/02/write-object-oriented-typescript-abstraction/), [types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-aliases), [interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#interfaces), [access modifiers](https://www.typescripttutorial.net/typescript-tutorial/typescript-access-modifiers/), [abstract Classes and Members](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#abstract-classes-and-members), etc.

OOP and design patterns originate from the typed programming languages. JavaScript is not like that and does not have full coverage for the keywords at the moment. While it is possible to, sort of, implement them using JavaScript flexibility, it will look hacky, and it is not recommended for usage in production.

On the other hand, TypeScript was built specifically to provide the support for mentioned things and much more. And TypeScript [becomes more used and popular](https://postlight.com/insights/why-the-world-is-adopting-typescript) from year to year.
